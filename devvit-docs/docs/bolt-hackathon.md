Welcome to everyone participating in the World’s Largest Hackathon by Bolt!

Reddit is proud to sponsor the Silly Sh!t challenge in the Hackathon where we celebrate the whimsical, the bizarre, and the hilariously impractical projects that serve no real purpose but bring maximum joy.

Devvit, or Reddit’s Developer Platform, allows you to build games and apps that run in Reddit. Take a look at some high quality games such as [Riddonkulous](https://www.reddit.com/r/riddonkulous/), [BuildIt](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildit/) and [Ducky Dash](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditGames/comments/1l2vq3t/daily_challenge_ducky_dash_june_4_2025/).

But for this challenge you are not limited to high quality games. You can use Bolt to vibe code your way to **something silly** that has no reason to exist, and serves no purpose except to be fun.

Visit our [AI Tools section](devvit_web/ai_tools.mdx) for more information on how to use our [Bolt Template](https://github.com/reddit/devvit-bolt-starter-experimental)

Even after the hackathon, you can still earn money with your Devvit project. Visit our [Reddit Developer Funds](reddit_developer_funds.md) page for more information on how you can earn money from your Devvit app or game. This program currently allow developers to get paid as apps achieve certain usage metrics, **with payments up to $116,500+ per app**

We hope you have fun with the challenge!
