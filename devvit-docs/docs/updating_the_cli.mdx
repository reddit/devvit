# Updating the Devvit CLI

There are currently two ways to update the Devvit CLI, depending on how you installed it.

    The easiest way to check how you installed the CLI is to run this command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    npm list -g --depth=0
    ```

    If you see a line that starts with `devvit@`, it means you have the CLI installed globally. If
    not, you likely have it installed as a dev dependency in your project - you can check this by
    looking for `devvit` in your project's `package.json` file under the `devDependencies` section.
    (If you don't see it in either place, you may not have the CLI installed at all, in which case,
    you can follow the [quickstart guide](./quickstart) to install it.)

## 1. If you installed the CLI as a dev dependency

This is the recommended way to install the CLI, as it ensures that your project uses a specific
version of the CLI, and makes it substantially easier to both update the CLI, and know what version
of the CLI you're using.

To update the CLI, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install --save-dev devvit@latest
```

(Or, if you're using a different package manager, use an equivalent command to update the `devvit`
package to the latest version, and save it as a development dependency. *DO NOT* save it as a
regular dependency - we don't need the CLI code uploaded with your app!)

## 2. If you installed the CLI globally

If you installed the CLI globally, ideally, you should uninstall the global version and install it
as a dev dependency in your project instead. To do this, inside your project, run the following
commands:

```bash
npm uninstall -g devvit
npm install --save-dev devvit@latest
```

If you still want to keep the CLI installed globally, you can update it by running the following
command:

```bash
npm install -g devvit@latest
```

This will update the global version of the Devvit CLI to the latest version. However, please note
that this is not recommended, as it can lead to inconsistencies between the CLI version used in
your project and the global version. It's best to use the CLI as a dev dependency in your project
to ensure that you're always using the same version across different environments.
