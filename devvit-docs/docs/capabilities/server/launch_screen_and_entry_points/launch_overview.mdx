# Overview

Devvit’s interactive framework gives you powerful ways to shape how users experience apps, from launch screen to expanded screen viewing. With view modes, HTML-based launch screens, and multiple entry points, you can design apps that feel native and respond to how users interact across the Reddit platform.

View modes define how your app appears:

- **Inline mode** loads your app’s web view directly inside the post unit, either in the feed or on the post details page. Users can interact immediately without additional taps or page loads.

- **Expanded mode** opens your app or game in a larger, full-screen view, ideal for immersive experiences such as games, creative tools, or detailed interactions on mobile.

**Launch screens** are the first thing users see before your main app loads. These HTML-based screens give you complete control over their design, animation, and loading behavior using the same tools and styles as your app itself.

This is an example of an inline launch screen:

<img src={require('../../../assets/quiz_planet_inline_screen.jpg').default} alt="Inline launch screen" style={{maxWidth: '350px', height: 'auto'}} />

**Entry points** act as a router that organizes your app across different view modes. Each entry point specifies the initial HTML file for the specific context. A user might experience your app inline, when it’s embedded in a post, or launch it in expanded mode for a larger, full-screen mobile experience.
