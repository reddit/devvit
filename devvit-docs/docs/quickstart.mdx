# Quickstart

This guide will help you create your first Reddit Developer Platform app in minutes. For a more detailed walkthrough, see the [**building an app guide**](dev_guide).

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you'll need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v22.2.0+)
- A [test subreddit](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001766991-How-to-create-a-subreddit) that you moderate (with less than 200 members)
  - After creating a test subreddit, visit your Safety Filters under mod tools (https://www.reddit.com/mod/[your_subreddit_name]/safety) and turn off the Reputation filter
- A code editor (we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

    You'll need Node.js to work with TypeScript and Devvit. Here are two ways to install it:

**Option 1: Using nvm (Recommended)**

[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) lets you easily manage multiple Node.js versions.

For macOS/Linux:

```bash
# 1. Install nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.6/install.sh | bash

# 2. Close and reopen terminal

# 3. Install Node.js
nvm install node
```

For Windows:

1. Install [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
2. Restart terminal
3. Run `nvm install node`

**Option 2: Direct Installation**

1. Download from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org)
2. Run the installer

:::caution
Direct installation may cause permissions issues. We recommend using nvm instead.
:::

**Verify Installation**

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

## Step-by-step guide

Follow these steps to install Devvit and create your first app.

1. **Install the Devvit CLI** - Choose your preferred package manager:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>
    ```bash npm install -g devvit ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">
    ```bash yarn global add devvit ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm" default>
    ```bash pnpm install -g devvit ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

2. **Log in to Reddit**

```bash
devvit login
```

3. **Create a new project**

```bash
devvit new --template blocks-post
cd my-project
```

:::tip Pro tip
If you're already a savvy web developer, use `--template web-view-post` (instead of the `blocks-post` template in step 3) to use the [webview component features](webviews.md).
:::

4. **Upload your app**

```bash
devvit upload
```

5. **Playtest your app**

```bash
devvit playtest <my-subreddit>
```

:::tip
Replace `<my-subreddit>` with your test subreddit name (e.g., `devvit playtest r/MyTestSub`).
:::

## Test your app

1. Visit your subreddit
2. In your menu actions, you should see a button that says "Add my post"
3. Refresh your subreddit page, and you should see a counter app
4. As you make code changes, playtest automatically rebuilds and deploys
5. Simply refresh the page to see your latest changes
6. View realtime logs while playtest is active
7. Press `Ctrl + c` to stop playtest

:::tip
If you don't see your post, visit your Safety Filters under mod tools (https://www.reddit.com/mod/[your_subreddit_name]/safety), turn off the Reputation filter, and try again.

## Choose your path

Here are the recommended next steps:

- Learn about [building interactive posts](./interactive_posts.md)
- Check out the [showcase](/docs/showcase/apps.mdx) to see example apps
- Learn how to [publish](dev_guide/#9-publish) your app

:::note
Reddit collects usage metrics when you use the Devvit CLI. See
[Reddit's Developer Terms](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/developer-terms) and
[Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/policies/privacy-policy). Opt out with `devvit metrics off`.
