# Template Library

Here are some starter projects and templates for your Devvit projects

## Devvit Web

[Devvit Web](../capabilities/devvit-web/devvit_web_overview.mdx) lets you use most web technologies to build your app, and we’ve created a few templates with preinstalled libraries to help you get started. You can clone the repos just like you did in the quickstart.

- [React starter](https://github.com/reddit/devvit-template-react) - a boilerplate project scaffolding to help you kickstart your React project. It includes preinstalled libraries for Devvit, Vite, React, Express, Tailwind, and TypeScript for faster development.

- [Three.js starter](https://github.com/reddit/devvit-template-threejs) - a tower blocks example that shows you how to create 3D graphics in the browser. It includes preinstalled libraries for Devvit, Vite, Three.js, Express, and TypeScript. This template is great for visualizations and games.

- [Phaser starter](https://github.com/reddit/devvit-template-phaser) - a feature-rich HTML5 game framework for building 2D games in the browser. It includes preinstalled libraries for Devvit, Vite, Phaser, Express, and TypeScript. This template is good for handling physics, animations, input, sound, and asset management.

- [Hello world](https://github.com/reddit/devvit-template-hello-world/tree/main) - a simple template to build a counter app with no frameworks or opinions.

## Devvit Blocks

[Devvit Blocks](../capabilities/blocks/overview.md) lets you build applications that run inside of a Reddit post, using Reddit's own design system: optimized for performance and cross-platform compatibility.

- [Blocks Empty Template](https://github.com/reddit/devvit-template-blocks) - an empty project leveraging Devvit Blocks

- [Payments Template](https://github.com/reddit/devvit-template-payments) - a template that contains all boilerplate code to enable [Devvit Payments](../earn-money/payments/payments_overview.md) in your Blocks app.

## Mod Tools

Devvit allows you to build custom mod tools, to help Moderators on Reddit manage the conversations in their subreddits, keeping their communities safe.

- [Mod tool template](https://github.com/reddit/devvit-template-mod-tool) - a fully functional repository containing the code for Comment Mop, a mod tool that helps moderators clear a comment and all of its descendants. This template shows [Menu Actions](../capabilities/client/menu-actions.mdx) and [Reddit API](../capabilities/server/reddit-api.mdx) at work.
