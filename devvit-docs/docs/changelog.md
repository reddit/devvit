# Changelog

While we're always shipping fixes and improvements, our team bundles new features, breaking changes, and other user-facing updates into regular releases. This page logs the changes to each version of Devvit.

Before upgrading `@devvit/public-api` in your project, always update the CLI first by running `npm install -g devvit`.

## Devvit 0.11.5: @devvit/security and some smaller updates

**Release Date: Dec 17, 2024**

We've identified a security vulnerability with forms that use the `forUserType: 'moderator'`. Apps that have mod-only actions should update to the latest version of the public API by January 15, 2025. Once updated, we will help you upgrade installations across subreddits that use your app. To update your app, run:

```
npm install -g devvit@latest // or package manager of choice
devvit update app
npm install
```

**New features**

- Added an [`hMGet`](./capabilities/redis.md#hash) method to Redis to get the value of multiple keys from a hash.
- Redis is available to all apps now, so you don't have to define `redis: true` within the configuration object.

**Fixes**

- Updated `reddit.getCurrentUserByUserName` to return undefined when a user is not found instead of throwing an error.
- Fixed the hanging process when `devvit playtest` got stuck installing a playtest version.

## Devvit 0.11.4: Payments (pilot) and more

**Release Date: Dec 9, 2024**

Release 0.11.4 introduces [payments](./capabilities/payments.md)! This pilot program lets you add products to your app and get paid for what you sell. The payments plugin enables the capability for users to purchase in-app products, like additional lives in a game or custom flair.

Since this is a pilot program, you'll need to submit an [enrollment form](https://forms.gle/TuTV5jbUwFKTcerUA) before developing and playtesting payments in your app. Before you publish your app, you’ll need to complete additional steps outlined in the payments documentation.

We’ve also added a new [template](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/capabilities/payments#add-payments-to-your-app) to help you set up payments functionality without needing to code a full app from scratch.

**New features**
This release also includes:

- A `finally:` parameter for [useAsync](./working_with_useasync.md) that lets your app setState when an async response is returned.
- The ability to use runAs with [setCustomPostPreview](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/api/redditapi/classes/models.Post#-setcustompostpreview).
- Experimental [web views](./webviews.md) functionality on the latest iOS and Android clients.

**Fixes**
Release 0.11.4 corrected issues with duplicate logs and fixed the 502 error that was occurring during Redis transactions.

## Devvit 0.11.3: Web views (experimental), server-side functions, and other public API updates

**Release Date: Nov 18, 2024**

0.11.3 adds a new way for developers to build UI with web views and server-side functions.

**[Web views](./webviews.md)** - is an experimental alternative to Devvit blocks, where you can build interactive posts and bring your own html/css/js into apps. This allows you to have access to standard web APIs and frameworks and access to animations and gestures not available in blocks. Note that this is an experimental feature that only works on web and is subject to significant changes over the next few months.

**Server-side functions** - We heard that developers are concerned that their app code for interactive posts is exposed to clients (which is done for performance purposes). This release includes new [server-side functions](./capabilities/server-side-functions.md) so that you can run functions from a `/*.server.ts` or `/server/*.ts` file to keep your codebase private. Those functions will run server-side and trigger a re-render.

We also made a few other changes to our public API in this release:

- [post.getEnrichedThumbnail](./api/redditapi/classes/models.Post.md#getenrichedthumbnail) allows developers to get a better thumbnail
- Community fix: Allow [WikiPage revision author](./api/redditapi/classes/models.WikiPage.md) to be undefined (Thanks PitchforkAssistant)
- Community fix: Include conversations IDs sorted array from [modMail.getConversations](./api/redditapi/classes/models.ModMailService.md#getconversations) (Thanks Pitchfork Assistant x2!)

## Devvit 0.11.2: Text fallback and post API client changes

**Release Date: Oct 31, 2024**

0.11.2 adds [textFallback](./text_fallback.md) functionality to ensure that text in your app is accessible and functional on every surface. Old Reddit doesn't render interactive posts, and this ensures that your app can have a text fallback for those cases.

This release also includes a few API updates:

- [setCustomPostPreview](./api/redditapi/classes/models.Post.md#setcustompostpreview) lets you update and [customize the post preview](./interactive_posts.md#customize-the-post-preview) with real content in the loading screen after the post has been created.
- [setSuggestedCommentSort](./api/redditapi/classes/models.Post.md#setsuggestedcommentsort) provides options for sorting comments on a post.
- `forUserType: member’` has been removed from menu items. If you want a menu action to be visible to all users, omit the `forUserType` field.

## Devvit 0.11.1: New automod filter trigger, playtest connect, and other improvements

**Release Date: Oct 21, 2024**

0.11.1 includes [a new trigger](capabilities/triggers.md) for when posts and comments are filtered by automod. We’ve also included some other improvements including:

- Playtest now defaults to using `--connect`, which sends client side logs that are in your browser into your CLI/terminal if you use the `?playtest` [parameter](playtest.md).
- Public API changes:
  - Updated parameters to improve modmail conversation routing:
    - Added `createModInboxConversation()`, which sends a message from the app account to subreddit mods via Mod Inbox.
    - Added `createModDiscussionConversation()`, which does the same thing via Mod Discussions.
    - Deprecated `modMail.createConversation()`.
  - Fixed [`modMail.muteConversation`](api/redditapi/classes/models.ModMailService.md) to take in proper values for numHours (defaults to 72).
  - Fixed context that was not being properly passed in `reddit.banUser` methods (thanks to fsv for the community contribution!).

## Devvit 0.11.0: Platform updates, breaking changes, and useAsync

**Release Date: October 9, 2024**

One of the biggest issues for devs who are building experiences is that data fetching slows down the render of the app. Devvit 0.11.0 introduces a new platform architecture for improved performance and scalability. This release includes a new, experimental [useAsync](working_with_useasync.md) feature that allows you to fetch data in a non-blocking way and a new hook architecture that lets you build composable hooks.

These platform upgrades create breaking changes for some apps. We’re releasing 0.11.0 on [@Next](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/next/) (the experimental branch of Devvit), so current app functionality will still work as you migrate your apps over to the updated platform.

To get started on 0.11.0:

1. Run `npm install -g devvit`.
2. Run `devvit update app` and `npm i` to update your app.

**New Features**

- **Faster rendering**. `useAsync` is a new hook that lets you fetch data without blocking the render. This is an experimental feature that we will be iterating on over time.
- **Composable hooks**. Now you can create hooks that can be shared across projects. While you could do this with the old hooks off context, rendering bugs prevented you from using them in various parts of your app. With this release you can abstract everything into hooks.

```ts
import { Devvit, useState } from '@devvit/public-api';

const useCounter = (startingCount: number) => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(startingCount);

  return {
    counter,
    increment: () => setCounter((x) => x + 1),
    decrement: () => setCounter((x) => x - 1),
  };
};

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { counter, increment } = useCounter(5);

  return (
    <vstack>
      <text>Count: {counter}</text>
      <button onPress={() => increment()}>Increment</button>
    </vstack>
  );
};
```

- Hooks can be imported from the package instead of relying on `context`:

```ts
// Old pattern
import { Devvit } from '@devvit/public-api';

const MyComponent = (context) => {
  const [count, setCount] = context.useState(0);

  return <hstack></hstack>;
};

// New pattern
import { Devvit, useState } from '@devvit/public-api';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return <hstack></hstack>;
};
```

**Breaking changes**

- Asynchronous components are no longer supported and will throw an error.

```ts
// Old pattern
const MyComponent = async () => {
  const data = await redis.get('count');

  return <hstack></hstack>;
};

import { useState } from '@devvit/public-api';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data] = useState(async () => redis.get('count'));

  return <hstack></hstack>;
};

// New pattern: if you want this request to be non-blocking you can use useAsync
import { useAsync } from '@devvit/public-api';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { data, loading } = useAsync(async () => await redis.get('count'));

  return <hstack></hstack>;
};
```

- You can no longer use forms created with `Devvit.createForm` inside of render.

```ts
// Old pattern
const myForm = Devvit.createForm(
  {
    fields: [
      {
        type: 'string',
        name: 'food',
        label: 'What is your favorite food?',
      },
    ],
  },
  (event, context) => {
    // onSubmit handler
    context.ui.showToast({ text: event.values.food });
  }
);

const MyComponent = (context) => {
  return (
    <hstack>
      <button onPress={() => context.ui.showForm(myForm)}>Show form</button>
    </hstack>
  );
};

// New pattern
import { Devvit, useForm } from '@devvit/public-api';

const MyComponent = (context) => {
  const myForm = useForm(
    {
      fields: [
        {
          type: 'string',
          name: 'food',
          label: 'What is your favorite food?',
        },
      ],
    },
    (event, context) => {
      // onSubmit handler
      context.ui.showToast({ text: event.values.food });
    }
  );

  return (
    <hstack>
      <button onPress={() => context.ui.showForm(myForm)}>Show form</button>
    </hstack>
  );
};
```

**Deprecated Features**

- Using hooks (like useState) off `context` is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. This change improves the performance of your app and makes it easier to write shareable hooks.

```ts
// Old pattern
import { Devvit } from '@devvit/public-api';

const MyComponent = (context) => {
  const [count, setCount] = context.useState(0);

  return <hstack></hstack>;
};

// New pattern
import { Devvit, useState } from '@devvit/public-api';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return <hstack></hstack>;
};
```

- API methods related to Reddit's Post Collections functionality have been removed, as the [feature was removed from Reddit several months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1am4b0e/deprecating_post_collections_mark_as_oc_and/).

**Improvements and updates**

**CLI**

- Improved error messaging
  - Pass 4xx errors up to developers
  - Ensure stack traces have the full path in message
  - New playtest error for app not yet existing
  - New error for apps blocked on upload due to asset folder sizes
- Improved image asset upload batching
- Added retry calls from CLI to Portal that fail
- `devvit new --help` output fixed

**Context**

- Set `appName` and `appVersion` on public Context
- Added `subredditName` to Context
- Added support for getting locale and timezone in uiEnvironment

**Portal**

- Improved error messaging
- Added an error for why an app is ineligible when installation fails

**Reddit API**

- Added `getSubredditInfo` methods to Reddit API plugin
- Made `redditId` and `label` optional on ModNotes
- Correctly set `revisionDate` on WikiPage type
- Now returns `contentHtml` on WikiPage
- Updated subredditStyles type
- Updated moderator permissions list to match API model
- Fixed bugs with reddit.inviteModerator() API call
- Added `ignoreReports()` to Comment model

**Other fixes**

- Added realtime channel message type errors.
- Reduced false alarms for hook errors. Previously, hook errors were firing in valid use cases. Hook rules still apply. If you see this error: `Error: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called at the top-level of a function component. Make sure that you are not calling hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.`, it is most likely caused by an error inside of your code.
