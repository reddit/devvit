# From Hackathon Win to 300K+ Players: How Honk Took Flight on Reddit

When [u/thejohnnyr](https://www.reddit.com/user/thejohnnyr/) first started coding, he wasn’t dreaming of millions of players or thriving online communities. He was just trying to make his own version of Pokémon. Years later, after a detour into software engineering, he quit his job to chase game development full-time — and ended up building one of Reddit’s most beloved community games: [_Honk_](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditgames/).

Today, Honk has more than **300,000 subscribers**, a passionate community of creators, and players who spend hours designing or conquering levels. We talked with Johnny to learn more about his journey, his experience building for Reddit, and what’s next for _Honk_.

## From side projects to full-time game development

Johnny’s path to game dev wasn’t a straight line. After dabbling in coding games in college, he pursued a more traditional software engineering career. But two years ago, he decided to take the leap:

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
“On a whim, I jumped into building games full time! I wasn’t making any money, but picked up contract software work on the side to pay the bills. I chose web platforms because I love that web games are accessible to anyone, without downloads or installs. Plus, it’s a fun challenge to optimize for performance since players load the game fresh every time.”  
</div>
<br>

That passion for accessibility and optimization laid the foundation for what would become his breakout success.

## Discovering Reddit’s Developer Platform

Johnny stumbled across Reddit’s new Developer Platform, [Devvit](https://developers.reddit.com/), in his own feed. At the time, he had already been experimenting with web games for two years.

When Reddit announced a hackathon, he decided to give it a shot — and won first prize with _Chook_, a 3D low-poly multiplayer game where Redditors work together to feed a virtual chicken.

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
“This was my first hackathon ever, and I put a ton of work into Chook over three weeks. Winning felt incredible. It gave me the confidence to try something even bigger.”  
</div>
<br>

That “something bigger” arrived just days later.

## The birth of Honk

Fresh off the [hackathon win](https://www.reddit.com/r/Devvit/comments/1jwwzsq/announcing_the_winners_of_hack_reddit/), Johnny hacked together another game over a weekend. His goal? A simple spin on _Honk_, designed to feel “Reddit-y,” with a live leaderboard that would draw players in.

What started as a small experiment quickly evolved into a thriving ecosystem:

- **User-generated levels**: Redditors can design and share their own Honk courses.

- **Cosmetics and quests**: Players can customize their goose and unlock challenges.

- **Community-driven updates**: Feedback from players directly shapes new features.

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
“Some days I spend the entire day just coding new Honk features. It’s addictive — every time I release an update, the community response is amazing.”  
</div>
<br>

The numbers speak for themselves: over 300,000 subscribers and countless hours poured into custom levels.

## The power of user-generated content

Johnny credits Honk’s explosive growth to one feature: the **level builder**.

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
“I launched the game with just classic mode and was getting decent traction. But once I added the level builder, things really took off. People immediately started creating a new level every minute — and using game objects in ways I never expected. That fresh content kept pulling in new users through Reddit’s feed algorithm.”  
</div>
<br>

From self-playing “auto levels” to creative story-driven challenges, the ingenuity of Redditors has kept the game fresh and endlessly re-playable.

Check out some of Johnny’s favorite player-made levels:

- [The Doom of the Kittens](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditGames/comments/1mhhjpa/the_doom_of_the_kittens/)

- [Save the Train](https://www.reddit.com/r/FlappyGoose/comments/1mm2lr8/save_the_train_and_clear_the_tracks/)

- [No Swimming](https://www.reddit.com/r/FlappyGoose/comments/1mukqlf/no_swimming/)

- [Let the Clouds Guide You](https://www.reddit.com/r/FlappyGoose/comments/1m6rh6y/let_the_clouds_guide_you/)

## Keeping it free and fun

Monetization is always a tricky question for indie developers. For Johnny, the answer was simple:

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
“I wanted to keep Honk totally free to play, with no pay-to-win features. Players can earn gems and feathers just by playing, but for those who don’t have time to grind, there’s an option to buy cosmetics. It supports development without compromising fairness.”  
</div>
<br>

That decision has kept the community happy — and growing.

## Building with Reddit

Beyond the player community, Johnny highlights Reddit’s Developer Platform team as a key partner in _Honk_’s success.

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
“The Reddit team has been fantastic. They’ve helped with promotion, infrastructure, bug fixes, even hotfix approvals at odd hours. Honestly, all I’ve had to do is focus on building the game.”  
</div>
<br>

That support, paired with Reddit’s built-in network effects, makes the platform a dream for indie developers looking to find an audience.

## Advice for aspiring Reddit game devs

For other developers considering Reddit’s Developer Platform, Johnny has some clear advice:

- **Embrace UGC**: “User Generated Content is your friend.”

- **Think mobile-first**: Most players will be on phones.

- **Launch early**: Don’t wait for perfection — test ideas quickly and see what sticks.

And above all:

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
“Absolutely go for it! Even if your game doesn’t blow up, you can still reach new audiences and potentially earn money. Compared to past projects that went undiscovered, Reddit is magnitudes better.”  
</div>

## Looking ahead

With _Honk_ soaring, Johnny’s eyes are on the future — not just for his game, but for Reddit’s developer ecosystem.

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
“I’d love to see Reddit host a convention or meetup for developers. Meeting fellow devs and the team in person would be amazing.”  
</div>
<br>

Until then, he’ll keep building, updating, and honking forward — one goose at a time.
