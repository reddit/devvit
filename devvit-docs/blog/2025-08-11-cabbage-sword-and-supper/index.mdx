Tokyo-based game studio [Cabbage Systems (キャベツ・システムズ合同会社)](https://www.cabbagesystems.com/) is no stranger to experimentation. Originally formed from a desire to build games in new places online — Reddit turned out to be a perfect fit. 
We caught up with their team to hear how they approached building their latest game on Reddit, how they leaned into the platform's unique culture, and what they learned along the way.




## A Gourmet Frog, Reddit-Style

Cabbage began experimenting with Reddit games during a small prototype project, [r/DarkDungeonGame](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkDungeonGame), and saw potential for something bigger.

> "We knew we wanted to go a lot bigger this time—something with the potential to sustain itself through monetization but that would also really work with the grain of how Redditors use Reddit."

After researching what types of games resonated with Reddit’s communities, they landed on an idle RPG format, with bite-sized gameplay loops that users could engage with throughout their feed.

That’s when the team asked a game-changing question: “Why are characters in these games always walking to the right? Where are they going?”

Their answer: Dinner of course!

Enter: a sword-fighting gourmet frog, battling through monsters on a mission for his next meal → [r/SwordAndSupperGame](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwordAndSupperGame/).

# Building on Reddit with Devvit

Cabbage leaned fully into Reddit’s developer platform and the new webview-powered interactive posts. Their tech stack includes React for UI and Phaser for the game viewport, all built on top of [Devvit](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/devvit_web/devvit_web_overview).

> "We were very happy with the way these pieces fit together."

They also invested early in developer infrastructure, setting up a smooth continuous integration pipeline with GitHub and a private subreddit for QA testing.
This attention to tooling paid off — and now the Cabbage team ships with confidence.

# Designing with the grain of Reddit

Cabbage wasn’t just building a game on Reddit — they built a game for Reddit.

Their design centers on interactive posts: each mission in the game is its own post, created by a user and discoverable anywhere across the platform. In the Sword and Supper game your character persists across missions, gaining XP, loot, and abilities.

> "We believed intuitively that our game should live everywhere throughout a user's feed."

User-generated content is opt-in but highly encouraged, especially for discovery and growth of the community on Reddit. Mission creators can write short story intros and taunts for their enemies — with results ranging from witty burns to a full copy-paste of the Bee Movie script.

# Growing a Community 

Cabbage’s launch strategy was as much about building a player community as it was about shipping the game.

They started with a small closed beta subreddit of a few hundred players who understood the game was in active development. Once ready, those beta testers seeded the early access subreddit, helping onboard waves of new users organically.

> "Once post discovery turned on, new users started streaming in and found an already active community."

This phased approach paid off. As the game scaled, so did its player base and content ecosystem. Cabbage was also active in their community – posting updates and interacting with the redditors who loved their game. 

# Monetization, the Reddit Way

Cabbage integrated Reddit’s Payments API shortly after Early Access for it began. But rather than push aggressive monetization, they took a community-first approach.

Players can buy premium maps that create special missions — but everyone can play them.

> "Generosity is a deep part of the Reddit ethos… and we took that into mind with Sword and Supper. With payments it's been a real win-win for us, the community, and players."

They were pleased to find the API integration itself was smooth, and players appreciated the ability to give back in a way that benefited the whole community.

# Advice for Other Developers / Studios 

To studios considering Reddit as a platform, Cabbage says:

> "It's the perfect time to experiment with new ways to get your stuff in front of players."

With traditional funding and distribution models in flux, Reddit offers a new way to launch games and build community-driven momentum from day one.

As for what they’re hoping for next?
    
> "The biggest thing we're excited for is for more Redditors to know that games, including ours, are on Reddit and to give them a try!"
