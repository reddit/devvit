# More On Skyboard

Skyboard is a collaborative, city-builder game powered by Reddit’s developer platform and built using Bolt. This app transforms the r/Skyboard subreddit into a living, breathing digital landscape — where Redditors drop tiles, construct buildings, and shape the world together.

The result? A minimalist, endlessly scrolling MMO where your subreddit is the game world. There’s no download, no launcher — just your browser and your imagination.

# The Silly Sh!t Challenge

The _Silly Sh!t Challenge_ within the hackathon asked developers to embrace the weird and wonderful:

- _Build the silliest, strangest, most delightfully useless thing possible using Reddit x Bolt._

Skyboard nailed it by taking something familiar — the city-builder genre — and reimagining it in a Reddit way. It's a game built entirely out of community, creativity, and a bit of chaos.
