# $49K Hackathon is Live! Get Inspired by Past Winners + Honorable Mentions

Did you know? Our hackathon is live right now—with over $49,000 in cash prizes up for grabs! Submit your entry by September 17, 2025 for a chance to win.

## What we’re looking for

When judging, we go beyond “fun to play.” We also look for:

- Delightful user experiences
- Polished, thoughtful UI
- That unique sense of “Reddity-ness”
- How well the game might work in Reddit feeds

## Past winning apps

To spark some inspiration, we’re shining a spotlight on winning apps from our [Games & Puzzles Hackathon](https://www.reddit.com/r/Devvit/comments/1hvz8s8/announcing_the_games_and_puzzles_hackathon_winners/) earlier this year. Use these standout projects to get your creative gears turning!
