# Build an experience post

1. Login to Devvit.
2. Start a new project.

```tsx
devvit new <my-project>
```

3. Select the `experience-post` template.
4. Navigate to your project directory.

```tsx
cd <my-project>
```

5. If you want to add some additional flair to the template code, edit the `src/main.ts` file and save your changes.

6. Upload your project.

```tsx
devvit upload
```

7. Use playtest to check out your experience on a test subreddit that you moderate.

```tsx
devvit playtest <your-test-subreddit-name>
```

8. Go to your test subreddit to see your experience (you might need to hit refresh).
