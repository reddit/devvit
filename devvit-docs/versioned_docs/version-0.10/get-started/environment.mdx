# Environment setup

Set up and maintain your developer environment.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following software installed:

- Node.js v22.2.0 or higher
- Git v2.28.0 or higher

You'll also need an editor for viewing and editing code (we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).

## Install Node.js

    You’re going to work with TypeScript. In order for Typescript to work with Devvit, you’ll need a working Node.js environment and then the Devvit command line interface. Node.js is an open-source server environment that makes it possible to develop and run Javascript apps anywhere. Node.js lets you import and use packages (code that other people have written) into your code.

**Option 1: Use node version manager (nvm)**

Install or update [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to use as a handy command-line tool for managing multiple Node.js versions on your system. This will allow you to switch between different versions easily. If you to use a different node version manager, check out these [suggestions from npmjs.org](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

For macOS or Linux:

1. Run the following command line in your terminal to install nvm.

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.6/install.sh | bash
```

2. Close and re-open your terminal to have nvm available.

3. Install the latest version of Node.js.

```bash
nvm install node
```

For Windows:

1. Download and install nvm-windows by following the instructions in the repository.

2. Restart your terminal or command prompt.

3. Install the latest version of Node.js.

```bash
nvm install node
```

**Option 2: Use Node.js installer from nodejs.org**

1. Visit the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org) to download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Node.js and npm (the package manager for Node.js).

:::note
If you install Node.js this way, you may experience permissions issues when trying to run Devvit, which is [documented on NPM's website](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). Both NPM and us here at Reddit highly encourage you to use nvm if possible. If that's not possible, here are some tips on how to [fix these permissions issues](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). For Windows users specifically, please use a node version manager.
:::

Check that Node.js is installed correctly by running the following commands:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

You should see the version numbers for Node.js and npm as output.

## Install the Devvit CLI

To download and install the Devvit CLI, run one of the following commands:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>
    ```bash 
    npm install -g devvit
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">
    ```bash 
    yarn global add devvit 
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm" default>
    ```bash 
    pnpm install -g devvit 
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

If you see permission errors, please read [npm's official guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally). Yarn depends on the same configuration as npm.

## Login to Devvit

Run this to log into your _Reddit account_ using the Devvit CLI:

```bash
$ devvit login
```

A Reddit authentication page will open in your browser (if the page doesn&apos;t open automatically, you can use the link in the command line output). The Devvit CLI advances automatically once the [authentication process](../authentication.md) completes.

Once logged in you should be seeing something similar to this:

```bash
> Logged in as u/username
```

If you can't log in, make sure you are using a Reddit account that has been allowlisted for the Reddit Developer Platform.

## Update the Devvit CLI

As new versions of [`@devvit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/devvit) becomes available, you can run this to update your Devvit CLI to the latest version:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>
    ```bash 
    npm install -g devvit
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">
    ```bash 
    yarn global add devvit 
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm" default>
    ```bash 
    pnpm install -g devvit 
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

After updating the Devvit CLI, you can check the version by running:

```bash
$ devvit --version
```

You'll get a response like this:

```bash
> @devvit/cli/0.10.16 darwin-arm64 node-v20.2.0
```

To update the `@devvit` project dependencies to the currently installed CLI's version, run the following command from within your project directory:

```bash
$ devvit update app
```
