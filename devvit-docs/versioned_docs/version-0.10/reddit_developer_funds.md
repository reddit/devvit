# Reddit Developer Funds

[Sign up when you create an account!](https://developers.reddit.com/create-account) Reddit Developer Funds is a rewards program for adventurous devs who build successful [experiences](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/experiences) and mod tools on Reddit.

## What we’re looking for

We want creative new apps that enrich the Reddit community through:

- A new experience, like a [live score board](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/showcase/apps#live-scores) or [community bingo](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/showcase/apps#bingo)
- An entirely new community created around the app, like [r/pixelary](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pixelary/)
- A quality of life improvement that benefits hundreds of subreddits

## How it works

The Developer Funds program will run from July 1, 2024 - Dec 31, 2024. This program is focused on reach, and success will be measured by Qualified Views and Qualified Installs, defined as:

- A “Qualified View” is a view of your App that: 1) occurs after July 1, 2024; 2) lasts at least two seconds; 3) is in a subreddit that has a minimum of 1,000 members; and 4) is in a subreddit or on content that is eligible for monetization under Reddit’s Contributor Monetization Policy (e.g., that is Safe for Work).

- A “Qualified Install” means that a subreddit has your App installed and that subreddit: 1) has a minimum of 1,000 members; and 2) is eligible for monetization under Reddit’s Contributor Monetization Policy (e.g., that is Safe for Work).

Measurement and eligibility are further defined in our terms. Please reference our [terms](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/27958169342996) when evaluating your app performance.

## What you can get

The “Qualified View” rewards are cumulative, which means you’ll get paid for each threshold tier your app achieves.

| Tier           | Threshold                                 | Payout  | Cumulative Payout |
| :------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :------ | :---------------- |
| Tier 1 - Views | 100,000 qualified views within 30 days    | $500    | $500              |
| Tier 2 - Views | 1,000,000 qualified views within 30 days  | $5,000  | $5,500            |
| Tier 3 - Views | 10,000,000 qualified views within 30 days | $20,000 | $25,500           |

The “Qualified Install” threshold is met when your app exceeds the threshold below and maintains that number of qualified installs for a consecutive 7-day period:

| Tier     | Threshold              | Payout |
| :------- | :--------------------- | :----- |
| Installs | 500 qualified installs | $500   |
