# Templates

Devvit Web lets you use most web technologies to build your app, and we’ve created a few templates with preinstalled libraries to help you get started. You can clone the repos just like you did in the quickstart.

- [React starter](https://github.com/reddit/devvit-react-starter-experimental) - a boilerplate project scaffolding to help you kickstart your React project. It includes preinstalled libraries for Devvit, Vite, React, Express, Tailwind, and TypeScript for faster development.

- [Three.js starter](https://github.com/reddit/devvit-threejs-starter-experimental) - a tower blocks example that shows you how to create 3D graphics in the browser. It includes preinstalled libraries for Devvit, Vite, Three.js, Express, and TypeScript. This template is great for visualizations and games.

- [Phaser starter](https://github.com/reddit/devvit-phaser-starter-experimental) - a feature-rich HTML5 game framework for building 2D games in the browser. It includes preinstalled libraries for Devvit, Vite, Phaser, Express, and TypeScript. This template is good for handling physics, animations, input, sound, and asset management.

- [Hello world](https://github.com/reddit/devvit-hello-world-experimental/tree/main) - a simple template to build a counter app with no frameworks or opinions.

Do you have another template for a framework in mind? You can add to our library—learn how to [contribute a template](https://github.com/reddit/devvit-examples-experimental)! Here’s an example of a [tRPC template](https://github.com/reddit/devvit-examples-experimental/tree/main/examples/trpc).
