# AI tools

If you want to use AI tools to build your app, you’ll need an AI-powered code editor.

We’re working on IDE and builder-specific instructions. Right now we have Cursor. Bolt.new, Windsurf, and Firebase Studio are coming soon!

:::note
If you have other IDE or AI builders you want us to support, please reach out on r/Devvit or #devvit-vibe-coding in [Discord](https://discord.gg/Cd43ExtEFS).

## Bolt

The [Bolt Template](https://bolt.new/github.com/reddit/devvit-react-starter-experimental) includes bolt-specific prompts and scripts that help you to use devvit in Bolt's environment.

Click the button below to start the template directly in Bolt.new

<a target="\_blank" href="https://bolt.new/github.com/reddit/devvit-bolt-starter-experimental">
  <img
    height="36px"
    width="199px"
    src={require('../assets/ai-tools/open-in-bolt-2x.png').default}
  />
</a>

Here are the steps once you’re in bolt:

#### 1. Login

Run `npm run login` in Bolt's terminal. It will output a URL. Click on that URL and authenticate. You should receive a token. Paste that token back into Bolt's terminal

#### 2. App Set up

Run `npm run devvit:init` in Bolt's terminal. It will ask you questions about your app and then it will also output a URL. Similarly to step 1 above, complete the authentication in the new browser window and paste the token back into Bolt's terminal

#### 3. Configure your subreddit

Tell Bolt's chat window which subreddit you want to use for your application. Bolt will know how to configure your application to use that Subreddit.

#### Vibe code and test

Bolt will run `devvit playtest` after every change made to your codebase. Please note that your app is not going to be functional in Bolt's preview window. Every time you make a change, you should return to your subreddit to see the changes live there.

## Cursor

The [React](https://github.com/reddit/devvit-react-starter-experimental), [Three.js](https://github.com/reddit/devvit-threejs-starter-experimental), and [Phaser starter](https://github.com/reddit/devvit-phaser-starter-experimental) templates include a Cursor directory that provides project-specific rules for each folder and the Devvit Model Context Protocol (MCP). The [Devvit MCP](https://github.com/reddit/devvit-mcp) gives the Cursor agent access to Devvit docs and Devvit logs when running.

After you’ve installed Cursor, you can use an example repository to get started:

1. Clone an AI-enabled template repo.

2. In the .cursor file, you’ll see the mpc.json file, which should look like this:

```tsx{
  "mcpServers": {
    "devvit-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@devvit/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Check [Cursor's](https://www.cursor.com/) settings/MCP section. The Devvit MCP server should show a green active status indicator (you might need to refresh the screen).

4. Suggest a change to the agent to start coding!
