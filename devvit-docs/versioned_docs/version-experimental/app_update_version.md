## Update your subreddit app version

Currently, apps on a subreddit need to be manually updated when a new version is published.

1. Go to your "app details" page in developers.reddit.com and locate the subreddit you want to update.
2. If a new version of the app is available, an "Upgrade" button will be visible. Click this to update your app.
