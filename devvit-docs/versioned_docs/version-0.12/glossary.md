| _Apps_             | Apps are Devvit projects that customize the Reddit experience. They are: <ul><li>made up of one or more _actors_</li><li>versioned</li><li>publishable to the Devvit marketplace</li><li>installable into subreddits (and eventually user accounts)</li><li>at the end of the day, just code that is suitable to be stored in a repo</li></ul> |
| _CLI_              | A command line interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface (UI) used to run programs, manage computer files, and interact with the computer.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| _Devvit ecosystem_ | The Devvit ecosystem consists of a CLI tool to aid in app lifecycle (creation through publication), a Developer Portal to distribute apps, and a platform that allows apps to be run at scale on Reddit hardware.                                                                                                                              |
| _IDE_              | An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| _Moderator_        | A moderator, or a mod for short, is a redditor who volunteers their time to help guide and create Reddit's many communities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| _Node.js_          | Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting.                                                                                                                                                              |
| _Plugins_          | Plugins are _actors_ internal to Devvit. They are included in the runtime, meaning they're available to any actor in any app. They provide useful functions such as making RedditAPI calls, accessing a Devvit-provided Key Value Store, scheduling other actors, and more.                                                                    |
| _Protobuf_         | Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) is a free and open-source cross-platform data format used to serialize structured data. It provides a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data in a forward-compatible and backward-compatible way.                                                                |
| _Version control_  | Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| _yarn/npm_         | Package managers for Node.js                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
