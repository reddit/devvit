**Valid dimensions**

```tsx
<hstack backgroundColor="red" width="200px" height="200px">
  <zstack height="100%" width="100%" backgroundColor="green" />
</hstack>
```

Z stack dimensions are valid because it satisfies the following rules:

- Height: Parent block must have the height defined.

- Width: Parent block must have the width defined.

---

```tsx
<vstack backgroundColor="yellow" width="300px" height="300px">
  <hstack backgroundColor="red" height="200px">
    <zstack height="100%" width="100%" backgroundColor="green" />
  </hstack>
</vstack>
```

Z stack dimensions are valid because it satisfies the following rules:

- Height: Parent block must have the height defined.

- Width: Parent block must be stretching horizontally in a `vstack`.
  The parent `hstack` is stretching horizontally in the `vstack`, because the `vstack` does not have any alignment indicated on
  the cross axis. (See [alignment](../blocks/stacks#alignment))

---

```tsx
<vstack backgroundColor="yellow" width="300px" height="300px">
  <hstack backgroundColor="red" width="200px" grow>
    <zstack height="100%" width="100%" backgroundColor="green" />
  </hstack>
</vstack>
```

Z stack dimensions are valid because it satisfies the following rules:

- Height: Parent block must be growing vertically in a `vstack`.
  The parent `hstack` is growing vertically along the main axis of the `vstack` because it has grow indicated.
  (See [grow](../blocks/stacks#grow))

- Width: Parent block must have the width defined.

---

**Invalid dimensions**

```tsx
<vstack backgroundColor="yellow" width="300px" height="300px" alignment="start top">
  <hstack backgroundColor="red">
    <zstack height="100%" width="100%" backgroundColor="green" />
  </hstack>
</vstack>
```

Z stack dimensions are invalid because it does not satisfy any of the rules:

- Height: `hstack` is not growing vertically because it does not indicate `grow`.
  Therefore, there is no parent height for the `zstack` to base its `height=100%` on.
- Width: `hstack` is not stretching horizontally because because the `vstack` indicates an alignment.
  Therefore, there is no parent width for the `zstack` to based its `width=100%` on. Width will be omitted, because the relative width is invalid and the parent is an `hstack`.

---

**Inferred dimensions**

```tsx
<vstack backgroundColor="yellow" width="300px" height="300px">
  <hstack backgroundColor="red" width="200px" grow>
    <zstack height="100%" width="100%" backgroundColor="green" />
  </hstack>
</vstack>
```

In this example, the `hstack` infers its height definition from the `vstack` (height = 300px), so
the `zstack` dimensions are **valid**.

---

```tsx
<vstack backgroundColor="yellow" height="300px">
  <hstack backgroundColor="red" height="200px">
    <zstack height="100%" width="100%" backgroundColor="green" />
  </hstack>
</vstack>
```

In this example, the `vstack` does not specify width, so thereâ€™s nothing for the `hstack` to infer. The width of the `zstack` is **invalid**. Therefore, the width will be omitted.
