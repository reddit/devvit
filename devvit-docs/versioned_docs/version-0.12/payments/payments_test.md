# Test payments

Use the payments sandbox environment to simulate payment transactions. All apps automatically start in the payments sandbox.

## Start a playtest

To test your app:

1. Run `devvit upload` to upload your app to the Apps directory.
2. Run `devvit playtest` <test-subreddit-name> .

Once you start a playtest session, a new pre-release version of your app is automatically created and installed on your test subreddit. The pre-release version has a fourth decimal place, so if your current app is 0.0.1, the first pre-release version will be 0.0.1.1.

The pre-release version is updated and uploaded to your test subreddit every time you save your app code. Youâ€™ll need to refresh your subreddit to see the updated app. This may take a couple of seconds, so be patient.

## Simulate purchases

In your test subreddit, you can make simulated purchases to test your app. No gold deducted in this state.

To end your playtest, press CTRL + C in the terminal session where you started it.
