# Overview

Add products to your app and get paid for what you sell. The payments plugin lets you prompt users to buy premium features that you build into your app, like in-game items, additional lives, or exclusive features into your app.

## How to get paid

You’ll set the price of the products in your app in Reddit [gold](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/17331548463764-What-is-gold-and-how-do-I-use-it). Users will use gold to acquire the items, and an equivalent amount of gold will accumulate in your app account.

Information about payouts is located [here](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/30641905617428-Developer-Program#h_01J8GCHXEG24ZNR5EZZ9SPN48S).

## Prerequisites

You can use the sandbox to build and test payments, but before you can publish your app and sell products, you’ll need to:

- Verify you meet the [eligibility criteria](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/30641905617428-Developer-Program#h_01J8GCHXEG24ZNR5EZZ9SPN48S).
- Complete the verification process. You can start the process and check the status of your verification via your [settings page](https://developers.reddit.com/my/settings).
- Accept and comply with our [Earn Terms](https://redditinc.com/policies/earn-terms) and [Earn Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/earn-policy).

All products will be reviewed by the Developer Platform team to ensure compliance with our content policy. Products are approved during the [app review process](../publishing.md) after you publish your app.
