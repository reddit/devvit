# Help

The best place to get help is from one of our communities!
Our subreddit, [r/devvit](https://reddit.com/r/devvit), is a great place to discuss the platform, ask common questions, or share information about your app. This is also where we share important information and updates.

For quick troubleshooting or live support we recommend posting in our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/R7yu2wh9Qz). The devvit team and expert users (aka the Devvit Ducks ðŸª¿) are usually quick to reply. The server is also where we host office hours.

Weâ€™re always happy to offer more dedicated support in the form of live coding sessions or a private space to iterate on your project. If this is of interest to you, please reach out in one of the communities above.
Please read the community rules before participating.

To file a feature request or submit a bug, you can use our [public issues tracker](https://github.com/reddit/devvit/issues). We recommend also notifying the team if you are blocked by a lacking feature or bug.
