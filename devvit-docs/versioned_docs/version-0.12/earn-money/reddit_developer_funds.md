# Reddit Developer Funds 2025

Reddit developer funds is a way for developers to earn money for the apps they build. Devs can earn up to $500,000 for their apps, or $167,000 per app.

## What we’re looking for

We want creative new apps that enrich the Reddit community through:

- An entirely new community created around the app, like [r/pixelary](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pixelary/) or [r/riddonkulous](https://www.reddit.com/r/riddonkulous/)
- A quality of life improvement that benefits hundreds of subreddits

Check your [eligibility from your settings page](https://developers.reddit.com/my/settings) or [enroll here](https://www.reddit.com/earn/enroll).

## How it works

The Reddit Developer Funds 2025 program (the “Program”) will run from April 1, 2025 - Dec 31, 2025. The Program is focused on reach, and success will be measured by Daily Qualified Engagers and Qualified Installs defined as:

- A “Qualified Install” means that a subreddit has your app installed and that subreddit: 1) has a minimum of 1,000 members, and 2) is eligible for monetization under Reddit’s Earn Policy (e.g., that is Safe for Work).

- A “Daily Qualified Engager” is a unique user that clicks and takes an action in your App for a specific day that: 1) occurs after April 1, 2025; 2) is logged in; 3) is in a subreddit that has a minimum of 200 members, and 4) is in a subreddit or on content that is eligible for monetization under Reddit’s Earn Policy (e.g., that is Safe for Work).

Measurement and eligibility are further defined in our terms. Please reference our [terms](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/27958169342996) when evaluating your app performance.

The Daily Qualified Engagers threshold(s) are determined on a rolling seven day average, which means that the average Daily Qualified Engagers for your app over the prior seven days exceeds a given threshold.

| Tier     | Threshold              | Payout |
| :------- | :--------------------- | :----- |
| Installs | 250 qualified installs | $1000  |

The “Qualified Install” threshold is met when your app exceeds the threshold below and maintains that number of qualified installs for a consecutive 7-day period.
