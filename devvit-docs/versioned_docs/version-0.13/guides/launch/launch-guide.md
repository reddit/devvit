# Launch Your App

As you build your app, you can get valuable feedback from the community by launching your app in three stages:

- **Alpha**: Use this stage to validate your core concept and catch major issues early
- **Beta**: Test your game with real users on a public subreddit.
- **General Availability (GA)**: Share your app with all of Reddit!

How you launch your app in each of these stages depends on the type of app you’re building: a game or a community app.

## Games

Select your launch stage for instructions and guidelines to maximize your game's development.

   Launch your game on r/Devvit to get technical feedback from other devs and Reddit admins:

1.  Create a public subreddit for your game.
2.  Create a game post in your public subreddit.
3.  On a Friday, cross-post your game to r/Devvit with the flair "Feedback Friday”.

**Guidelines**

To get the best feedback:

- Post only once for a meaningful update (maybe a 2+ week gaps between versions)
- Respond to feedback within 24-48 hours.
- Test other developers' apps, too, to build relationships with your fellow devs.

  When you’re ready for broader player testing, launch your game on r/GamesOnReddit: 
  
  1. Go to your public subreddit for your game.
  2. Create a game post in your public subreddit.
  3. Cross-post a game post to r/GamesOnReddit with flair "Feedback”.

**Guidelines**

To get the best results, engage with players that give you feedback to start growing your community.

**Apps that have strong post engagement metrics will automatically move to the next launch phase.**

  When you're ready to publicly release your game:
  
  1. Upload the latest version of your app with `npx devvit upload`
  2. Publish your app with `npx devvit publish`
  
  Publishing your app triggers a thorough app review.

### Distribution

Once your game has been published and approved, it may be featured by Reddit in one or more ways, such as:

- Games directory
- Home feed distribution
- Featured promotional units

### Engagement

An approved app is automatically shared with a small number of redditors, and engagement metrics will determine if it is picked up by larger audiences.

Key engagement metrics for games include:

- Contribution generation - comments and posts created
- Click through rate - how often users engage with your app
- Dwell time - how long users spend in your app
- Post score - upvotes vs downvotes ratio

Successful games will generate genuine conversation within each post, and create compelling content that engages redditors.

## Community apps

Apps that are built to use within a community (think mod tools like Bot Bouncer or interactive post apps like Community Hub) also follow the alpha, beta, and GA launch path.

   Share your app on r/Devvit to validate that your app solves real community problems:

1.  Create a public subreddit for your game.
2.  Create a game post in your public subreddit.
3.  On a Friday, cross-post your game to r/Devvit with the flair "Feedback Friday”.

You can also solicit feedback on the #mod-discussion Discord channel. Write a short description of your app that explains the problem your app solves, target community types, and how it fits into existing mod workflows. Include screenshots of the mode interface, and see what the community has to say.

**Guidelines**

To get the best feedback:

- Post only once for a meaningful update (maybe a 2+ week gaps between versions).
- Test your app with different permission levels (mod, approved user, regular user).
- Actively seek feedback from mods in your target communities.

When you're ready to publicly release your app, you’ll need to add it to the Apps Directory:
