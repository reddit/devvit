# Getting started with {{name}}

Your project has been created using a Devvit template.

## Next up

Next up is uploading and developing your app using playtest.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `devvit upload`

Upload the app to the App Directory. Uploaded apps are only visible to you (the app owner) and can only be installed to a small test subreddit with less than 200 subscribers.

### `devvit playtest <subreddit-name>`

Installs your app to your test subreddit and starts a playtest session where a new version is installed whenever you save changes to your app code, and logs are continuously streamed.
