# Getting started with Devvit

Your project has been created using a Devvit template.

## Next up

Next up is uploading and developing your app using playtest.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `devvit upload`

Upload the app to the App Directory. Uploaded apps are only visible to you (the app owner) and can only be installed to a small test subreddit with less than 200 subscribers.

### `devvit playtest <subreddit-name>`

Installs your app to your test subreddit and starts a playtest session where a new version is installed whenever you save changes to your app code, and logs are continuously streamed.

## Using your app

You can use your app by clicking the subreddit options (top right, three dots) and clicking "Create a post to show off how purchasing works".

The app allows you to purchase "god mode" to test payment flows. It further shows you some metadata about payments in your app.

## Learn more

You can learn more in the [general documentation](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/) or [payments documentation](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/capabilities/payments).
