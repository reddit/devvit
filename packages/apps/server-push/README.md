A simple app that sends the current time from a server to all active clients every minute using Devvit's scheduler and realtime service.

This app demonstrates how to:

- Use Devvit's scheduler to run a recurring job every minute.

- Use the app install trigger to run an initialization job (i.e., starting the scheudler job).

- Use realtime service to send information from a server to all active clients.

- Use realtime service on clients to listen for updates from the server.

- Use Reddit Blocks to render the latest server time every time it is updated.
