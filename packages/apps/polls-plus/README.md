An expanded implementation of Reddit's popular Polls feature. This version allows for more than 6 options and offers users a "view results" button that lets them see the results without voting.

This app demonstrates how to:

* Use Reddit Blocks to create and interactive post experience.

* Use Redis transactions to safely increment variables and avoid race conditions.

* Use Redis mset to set multiple keys at once.

* Use Forms to allow user-generated poll questions.

* Use the Reddit API to send private messages.
