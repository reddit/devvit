A simple implementation of a realtime, multiplayer drawing canvas that is similar to Reddit's popular r/place experience.

This app demonstrates how to:

* Use Reddit Blocks to create an interactive post (i.e. a canvas with a clickable color palette that can be used to draw).

* Use the Devvit realtime service to enable live updates to a shared canvas.

* Use Redis to persist the canvas state.
