A moderation app that enables mods to give up to three strikes with escalating consequences to users who violate community rules.

This app demonstrates how to:

- Use menu actions (i.e., addMenuItem) as an entrypoint to Devvit apps and specifically limiting them to moderators only.

- Use Redis to persist user-level state.

- Use the Reddit API to send private messages and take moderator actions.
